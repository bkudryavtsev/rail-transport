### Visualizing Rail Infrustructure Investments, Road Accidents, and Air Emission

This was a project done for the SENG485D Data Visualization course at the University of Victoria. Using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), this web application visualizes data provided by the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/) on the yearly investments into rail infrastructure around the world, along with CO2 emissions, and road accidents data.
